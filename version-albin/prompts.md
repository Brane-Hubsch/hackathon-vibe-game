The goal is to create a web based multi player radio car game that can be played on users phone in the browser. The users should be connected to the same lobby and compete against each others. Users should be driving their car and try to bump in to each others. When a user bumps in to another users car it should push it closer to the edge of the game. If the user falls over the game is over for that user. The winner is the user that is the last man standing.
